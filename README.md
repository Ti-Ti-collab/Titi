## 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Titi

I'm a Data Analyst and Health Tech Enthusiast passionate about solving real-world problems through data-driven insights.

🎓 I recently completed a Health Analytics course, where I explored ER patient flows, lung cancer risk prediction, and bioinformatics. This included data wrangling, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and reporting — all toward leveraging clean data to build scalable machine learning models that support public health and potentially save lives.

I’m currently building projects in predictive modeling, healthcare analytics, and data storytelling using Python, SQL, Power BI, and DAX.

🚀 I'm actively growing my portfolio, collaborating with data communities, and seeking opportunities to apply analytics in meaningful, impactful ways.
